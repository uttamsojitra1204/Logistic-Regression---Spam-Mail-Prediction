# Logistic-Regression---Spam-Mail-Prediction

=> SMS Spam Detection System
- This project is an SMS Spam Detection System built with Python, leveraging machine learning techniques to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam). The model employs Logistic Regression and TF-IDF Vectorization to accurately identify spam messages based on their content.

=> Project Overview
- The aim of this project is to create a predictive model that can detect spam messages, which can be beneficial for email and SMS filtering systems. The dataset contains over 5,500 SMS messages, each labeled as either spam or ham, allowing the model to learn the distinguishing features of spam messages effectively.

=> Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling, handling any missing values and encoding labels (0 for spam and 1 for ham).
- Feature Extraction: Used TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text data into numerical features that are compatible with the Logistic Regression model.
- Model Training: Trained a Logistic Regression model, achieving an accuracy of 96.7% on test data.
- Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy scores on both training and testing data.
- Prediction System: Built a prediction system that classifies new SMS messages in real time as spam or ham.

=> Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains a collection of SMS messages labeled by category. It includes:
- Category: Indicates whether the message is spam (0) or ham (1).
- Message: The actual text content of the SMS.

=> Conclusion
- This SMS Spam Detection System demonstrates the effective use of machine learning and natural language processing techniques to accurately classify SMS messages as spam or ham. By leveraging TF-IDF Vectorization and Logistic Regression, the model achieved a high accuracy of 96.7%, making it a reliable tool for identifying spam messages. This project highlights the potential for machine learning models in filtering out spam, enhancing the user experience and helping maintain communication quality. Future improvements could involve experimenting with advanced algorithms to further increase accuracy and robustness, as well as developing a user-friendly interface for practical use.
